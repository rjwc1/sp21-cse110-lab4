## Part 3. Debugging using the DevTools

Question 1. When the user submits two numbers to sum, the code represents these values as strings in `num1` and `num2`. When adding these two values, we are concatenating these two strings rather than add the values into `result`, which is why the output shows the user input just concatenated together instead of added together.

Question 2. First, line 9 and 10 are missing semicolons. Second, to fix this we need to convert the values of `num1` and `num2` from their string representation to their number representation. We can achieve this with using the `parseInt()` method for `num1` and `num2`, which converts a string into an integer, and summing them will give us the proper `result`.
